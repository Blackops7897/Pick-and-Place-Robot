# Pick-and-Place-Robot
This project demonstrates a pick and place robot controlled by an ESP32 module. 
The robot is capable of picking up objects from one location and placing them at another. 
This system combines hardware components like servos, motors, and sensors with software programming to create a functional robotic arm.

Features:

ESP32 Control: Uses the ESP32 module for wireless communication and control.

Servo Motors: Enables precise movement of the robotic arm.

Gripper Mechanism: Allows the robot to pick up and release objects.

Sensor Integration: Utilizes sensors for object detection and positioning.

Customizable: Code and hardware can be customized for different applications.
